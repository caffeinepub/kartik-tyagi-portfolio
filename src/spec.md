# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update portfolio with green/black/white color theme, new profile photo, case studies, and optimized resume loading.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace entire color scheme with Green (#0f7b3f) + Black (#000000) + White (#ffffff) system, remove all orange tones and grey panels, add subtle black stripe design accents in section dividers
- Replace profile image with new professional headshot (profile pic 001.png) with circular crop, center aligned in hero, single appearance only, with subtle shadow
- Add VRH Derma case study (October 2025 – January 2026, 640%+ ROI, ₹6.4L+ spend, D2C skincare brand)
- Add Award-Wala case study (January 2026 – February 2026, ₹15K spend, B2B recognition business)
- Optimize resume loading by hosting in frontend/public, using direct file link with target='_blank', preloading in head, compressing below 1MB

**User-visible outcome:** Portfolio displays with professional green/black/white theme, updated profile photo, two detailed case studies with metrics, and instant resume access without page reload.
